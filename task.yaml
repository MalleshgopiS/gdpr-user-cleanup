  The "Bleater" platform is failing GDPR audits. When a user is deleted, only their
  credentials are removed, leaving "ghost data" across the architecture.

  Requirements for USER_ID 'user123':
  1. Delete Auth-DB record (PostgreSQL).
  2. Anonymize Posts (PostgreSQL): Change author_id to 'deleted_user' and redact PII content.
  3. Delete Profile document (MongoDB).
  4. Delete Session key (Redis).
  5. Delete Avatar object (MinIO).
  6. Ensure the script is idempotent.

  Database Details:
  - Auth DB: auth_db.users (id, email)
  - Bleat DB: bleat_db.posts (author_id, content)
  - MongoDB: db: bleater, collection: profiles
  - Redis Key: session:<USER_ID>
  - MinIO: bucket: avatars, object: <USER_ID>.png
